Let's take a deep breath and begin this meditation.

1/15: Start by finding a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground. Take a deep inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth, letting go of any tension in your body.

2/15: Visualize a warm, calming light shining down on you from above, surrounding you with its comforting energy. Allow yourself to fully bask in its radiance and let it fill you up with positivity and calmness.

3/15: As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine this light gradually streaming down through the top of your head, slowly making its way through your body. With each breath, feel it penetrating deeper and deeper, until it fills your entire being.

4/15: Focus your attention on your breath, feeling it flowing in and out of your body, letting it be your anchor in the present moment. Anytime you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts about calculus or the stress of finals, simply bring your awareness back to your breath.

5/15: Allow yourself to fully surrender to this moment, letting go of any worries or fears about the future. Right here, right now, everything is okay.

6/15: Bring your attention to the top of your head, visualizing the warm light streaming down and filling your head with its soothing energy. As it moves through your body, imagine it washing away any tension or stress, leaving you feeling lighter and more at peace.

7/15: Now bring your attention to your face and jaw. Relax any muscles that may be holding onto tension, and feel your facial muscles soften and release. Let any worries or concerns melt away, and allow yourself to fully let go.

8/15: As the light continues to move through your body, visualize it streaming down your neck and into your shoulders. Feel any tightness or discomfort melting away as the light gently massages your muscles.

9/15: Visualize the light moving down your arms and into your hands, warming and soothing every inch of your skin. Allow yourself to fully surrender to the feeling of relaxation and ease.

10/15: Bring your attention to your chest and stomach, feeling the light streaming through your heart and filling your body with love and compassion. Let any negative emotions or self-judgment be washed away by the comforting energy of the light.

11/15: Continue to breathe deeply, feeling the light streaming down through your hips and into your legs. Imagine it melting away any tension in your muscles, leaving you feeling weightless and at ease.

12/15: Visualize the light moving down through your knees and into your feet, bringing warmth and comfort to every toe. Allow yourself to fully surrender to this moment of relaxation and peace.

13/15: As you continue to breathe deeply, bring to mind an image of yourself succeeding in calculus. See yourself confidently answering every question with ease and grace.

14/15: Imagine the light within you growing stronger and more vibrant, fueling your inner strength and confidence. Trust that you have the ability to succeed, and let go of any doubts or fears.

15/15: Take a deep inhale through your nose, and as you exhale, slowly open your eyes. Take a moment to feel the sense of calm and peace that surrounds you, knowing that you have the inner strength to overcome any challenge. Thank yourself for taking this time to nourish your mind, body, and soul.
